Abstract from final analysis:

NBA players are widely known and respected for their play on the court. LeBron James and Stephen Curry are two of the biggest names in the league right now and are constantly in the media. They are also constantly in social media. They each have millions of followers from around the world and use various forms of social media to talk to their fans. One of the most popular forms is Twitter. The following project combines data from the NBA players' on-court performances with the sentiment of their Twitter data to see if there is a relationship that exists between them. However, since many players have been cited as saying the regular season doesn't mean as much to them, we already know that their tweets may not have a relationship with performance. But this doesn't mean that every player thinks that way. From this research, some players may have a relationship and others may not have a relationship between how they tweet and how they perform.
